# Fake Online Shop

This is a fake online shop created as part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is currently not hosted anywhere, but can be run on your machine by doing the following stops. 

    git clone git@github.com:DONTSTOPLOVINGMEBABY/learning-web-technology.git
    cd learning-web-technology/Odin-Project/Full-Stack-Javscript-Path/React/shopping-cart/
    npm install 
    npm start

I will post a link soon when the app is up and running. Enjoy!
