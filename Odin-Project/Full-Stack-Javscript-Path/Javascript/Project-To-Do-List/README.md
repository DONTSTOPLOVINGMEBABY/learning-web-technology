# Todo List Project

This is a simple front-end web application that allows a user to create and edit lists, projects, and notes to help keep their daily activities and life organized. Once a user creates a project, they are able to add todos to these projects and rank them based on their priority.
 
Other than the obvious functionalities that the user can intuit from using the application, there are a few simple yet fun tid-bits I included that make the experience feel more fluid. For example, the projects, notes, and list pages are all broken up into three columns, and every note, project, or list that is loaded is placed within one of these three columns. The algorithm will always make it so that any new item that is added is pinned to the column with the smallest height in order to avoid items being arranged in an awkward manner. 

## Languages and Technologies Used

## Current State of the Project

I probably won't be adding any more features to the application. At some point I might try to create the project using webpack to get some more experience with that sort of thing. Hope you enjoy!
