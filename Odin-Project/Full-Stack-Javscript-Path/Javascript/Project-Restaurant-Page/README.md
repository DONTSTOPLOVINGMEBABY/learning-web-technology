### Restaurant Project as Part of The Odin Project Curriculum  

The purpose of this project was to gain practice with Webpack and to get more comfortable with DOM Manipulation in pure JS. 

It was pretty straightforward and I learned a lot about webpack along the way. For some reason, I was unable to set the background image on the site, so it doesn't look as pretty as the mock-ups.
