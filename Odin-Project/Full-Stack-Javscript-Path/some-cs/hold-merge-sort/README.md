# Merge-Sort Assignment for The Odin Project

These programs were written as part of The Odin Project Curriculum on Computer Science, particularly Merge Sort. This folder contains 3 recursive merge-sort algorithms written in C, Python, and Javascript. 

The psuedo-code for Merge and Merge-Sort were taken from the popular textbook <em>Introducton to Algorithms -- Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein</em>. [The Link to the Textbook can be found Here](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=introduction+to+algorithms&qid=1673722953&sprefix=introduction+to+a%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-1).
