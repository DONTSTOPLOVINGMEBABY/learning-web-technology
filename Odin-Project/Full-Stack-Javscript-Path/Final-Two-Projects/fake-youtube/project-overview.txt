Fake YouTube Abstract: 

The site will be a mock version of YouTube, where the homepage is filled with thumbnails of different categories of videos, uploaded by different users. 
There will be three/four catgeories decided by me (sports, nature, drone videos, etc) and one section that is dedicated to user uploaded content. The user 
uploaded content section will show videos from the x most recent videos uploaded. People will have the chance to create accounts, where they can upload their own
videos, which will be displayed in the most recent videos uploaded. Users can interact with videos through a comments and likes sections. View counts will also be
displayed for each video. Users will have the ability to subscribe to channels so that they can be notified when their favorite creators post videos. 


Design Ideas
--------------

    Homepage: 
        Header

            - Youtube logo on the top left (serves as refresh point to get back to homepage when viewing videos)
            - Easy upload icon
            - Profile/stock photo when signed in. If not signed in, prompt for sign in.

        Thumbnails 
            - Top part contains video with timestamp in the bottom-right corner
            - Title is directly underneath the video
            - Uploader's profile picture, a link to their channel page, number of video views
            - Upload Date
            - Hover and video will start playing and transforms to something like 1.2x

            - Home
            - Channels
            - Playlists

        Broken Into Categories: 
            - Show Uploaded videos
            - Personal Playlists
            - Subscriptions

    Upload Page:
        - Just a simple page that has a button to select a file to upload, a title, and a description for the video 
        - Shows status bar as video is being uploaded. 
        
    
Functionalities
-------------
    1. Search
        - User should be able to search entire video library and receive live updates under search bar with results. 
        - Perhaps use a regex that cuts out capitals and puncutation to match search results with what user inputs
