1. Firestore 

    - Firestore is divided up into documents and collections 
    
    Documents
        - Documents are made up of key-value pairs and are very similar to JSON or dictionaries, which are referred to as fields in Firestore. 
        - Maps are smaller JSON objects embedded in a key-value pair, almost like a sub-field if you will 

    Collections
        - They are collections of documents. 
        - Like a hash or a dictionary, where each of the values are always going to be some kind of document.
            1. Collections can only conatin documents
            2. Can only be 1mb in size 
            3. Cannot contain another document. documents can point to other subcollections, but not other documents directly.
