## Top Updates

A journal to document my journey throughout the curriculum to date.

### November 7th, 2022
I began working through the foundations section of TOP curriculum around mid-october (about a month ago). I've worked on the project consistently everyday since, only taking off three or four days in total. Over this past month, I've learned fundamental HTML, CSS, and Javascript and feel confident I could design basic webpages for a personal site or even blog. More important than the fundamental concepts I've learned, TOP has made the process of learning web-development much clearer, and I feel much more confident in where I should be going moving forward. 

Today marks the day that I have finished the Foundations section of TOP (and largely why I've decided to post my first update for this repository today). I was nervous to begin such a directed and deep curriculum such as TOP, but I'm very glad I decided to stick with it. I am also very grateful for those who have taken the time and energy to make such an incredible project happen. Moving forward, I plan to pursue the Full-Stack-Javascript track to completion and look forward to learning more about Front and Backend Frameworks! I will attempt to post more frequent updates as I get deeper into the full-stack section of TOP. <hr>

### February 4th, 2023

I have been meaning to post an update to this README much sooner, but I have been avoidiing it as I've been more focused on trying to figure out a proper layout to present info about projects and these updates for this repo. Since it has been a while since my last update, I'll give a recent update as to where I've been at in the past week, and then go onto describe my thoughts on some things from 1-2 months prior. 

#### Current Update
It has been just shy of four months since I started this curriculum, and it has been an incredibly difficult and rewarding journey thus far. As of today, I am a few lessons shy of finishing the Full Stack Javascript Course. Recently, I have really been enjoying learning React, and am truly surprised by how much it has changed my approach/thinking to front-end development in such a short period of time. After I finish the Javascript section of the curriculum, I will only have three sections left of TOP, of which only two are technical (Advanced HTML & CSS and NodeJS). I am incredibly excited to dive headfirst into Node (and hopefully stick a nice landing) and begin to build full-stack web applications! 

The React learning curve was initially steep for the first week or so, and then everything rapidly picked up after that. There is still a lot of functionality I have to learn with React, but I'm looking forward to exploring some React frameworks shortly in the near future. 

#### Recap of Past 1-2 Months 
I have been working on the Javsascript section of TOP for a little more than two months now, and have covered a lot of stuff including OO in JS, Webpack, Asynch/APIs in JS, a solid CS section (including exercises/projects with Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Recursion, and Data Structures), Testing and Advanced GIT Practices, and React. I must say, I have continually found myself becoming frustrated with how long it has taken me to finish this one particular section, but I also recognize that this is a core module of the curriculum and that the lessons themselves have grown significantly in complexity. I did take some extra time in the CS section to implement extra Data Structures such as Doubly Linked Lists to expand my knowledge on the vast subject of Data Structures in Computer Science. 

Some interesting projects I have completed over this period are the [React Memory Game](https://henryjacobs.us/top-projects/memory-game/index) and the [Todo List in Vanilla JS](https://henryjacobs.us/top-projects/project-to-do-list/index). I spent around 80-100 hours working on the Todo  list application between styling, designing the UI, and building out all of the logic for the application from the ground up. All in, the application was just under 2500 lines, and showed me how simple applications can grow in complexity as more features are added. The Memory Game was relatively simple in its functionality, but was the perfect project to get practice with React Hooks. The Memory Project is my favorite project thus far in terms of simplicity and design.
