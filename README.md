# learning-web-technology

This repisotory holds code from various projects/exercises I am working on as part of my effort to expand my knowledge/scope of web technologies, frameworks, various programming languages, and anything else associated with Web technologies! My Journey with learning Web Technologies began with [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I have learned both front and back end frameworks and technologies as part of their full-stack Javascript curriculum.  


### Proficient Web Technologies and Frameworks

### What I am learning next
- Typescript
- Node 
- SASS
- CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- Django 
- React Frameworks (Redux, Next.js)
- Socket.io

And many others!
