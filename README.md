# learning-web-technology

This will be the repisotory I use to hold the code and resources I use to navigate beginnings in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and possibly many other web-technologies. I will be working my way through the ODIN project in the coming month. I believe that the structure of compiled resources and coursework combined with self-paced learning will be a good fit. It also helps that it's free! :D. 

I will post updates as to where I am with the project to this README or possibly to an updates file (I have not decided). Will check back in a few.
