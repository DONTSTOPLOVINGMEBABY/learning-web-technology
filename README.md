# learning-web-technology

This will be the repisotory that holds the code and resources I use to navigate beginnings in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and possibly many other web-technologies. I will be working my way through the ODIN project in the coming month(s). I believe that the structure of compiled resources and coursework combined with self-paced learning the ODIN Project will be a good fit. I know of someone who went through the program and saw success, so I am heeding their strategy. It also helps that it's free! :D. 

I will post updates as to where I am with the project to this README or possibly to an updates file (I have not decided). Will check back later with updates.
