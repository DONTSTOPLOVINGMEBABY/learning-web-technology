# learning-web-technology

This will be the repisotory that holds the code and resources I use to navigate beginnings in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and possibly many other web-technologies. I will be working my way through the ODIN project in the coming month(s). I believe that the structure of compiled resources and coursework combined with self-paced learning the ODIN Project will be a good fit. I know of someone who went through the program and saw success, so I am heeding their strategy. It also helps that it's free! :D. 

I will post updates as to where I am with the project to this README or possibly to an updates file (I have not decided). Will check back later with updates.

# The Odin Project Updates 

## November 7th, 2022
I began working through the foundations section of TOP curriculum around mid-october (about a month ago). I've worked on the project consistently everyday since, only taking off three or four days in total. Over this past month, I've learned fundamental HTML, CSS, and Javascript and feel confident I could design basic webpages for a personal site or even blog. More important than the fundamental concepts I've learned, TOP has made the process of learning web-development much clearer, and I feel much more confident in where I should be going moving forward. 

Today marks the day that I have finished the Foundations section of TOP (and largely why I've decided to post my first update for this repository today). I was nervous to begin such a directed and deep curriculum such as TOP, but I'm very glad I decided to stick with it. I am also very grateful for those who have taken the time and energy to make such an incredible project happen. Moving forward, I plan to pursue the Full-Stack-Javascript track to completion and look forward to learning more about Front and Backend Frameworks! I will attempt to post more frequent updates as I get deeper into the full-stack section of TOP.
